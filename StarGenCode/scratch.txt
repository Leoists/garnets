Planetary systems that display the major regularities and irregularities of the solar system have been produced in a series of computer experiments emplying a Monte Crlo technique. It is hypothesized that start sna planets form within cold, dark globules of dust and gas through aggregation of grains and inelastic collisions of particles. A computer program simulates the processes by which planets grow in accordance with this hypothesis from proplanetary nuclei on random
